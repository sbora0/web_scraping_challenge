Web Scraping Challenge Assignment 11

For this assignment there were two requirements as given below:

1. Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News

       •	Use automated browsing to visit the Mars news site "https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html". Inspect the page to identify which elements to scrape.
       •	Create a Beautiful Soup object and use it to extract text elements from the website.
       •	Extract the titles and preview text of the news articles and store each title-and-preview pair in a Python dictionary and, give each dictionary two keys: title and preview.
       •	Store all the dictionaries in a Python list and print the list in your notebook.
       •	Export the scraped data to a JSON file.

3. Scrape and Analyse Mars Weather Data
       
       •	Use automated browsing to visit the Mars Temperature data site "https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html". Inspect the page to identify which elements to scrape.
       •	Create a Beautiful Soup object and use it to scrape the data in the HTML table.
       •	Assemble the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame.
       •	Examine the data types that are currently associated with each column. If necessary, cast (or convert) the data to the appropriate datetime, int, or float data types.
       •	Analyse your dataset by using Pandas functions to answer the following questions:
   
                     o	How many months exist on Mars?
                     o	How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
                     o	What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars? by finding the average minimum daily temperature for all of the months and plotting the results as a bar chart.
                     o	Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? by finding the average daily atmospheric pressure of all the months and plotting the results as a bar chart.
                     o	About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year? by considering how many days elapse on Earth in the time that Mars circles the Sun once and visually estimate the result by                                    plotting the daily minimum temperature.

       •	Export the DataFrame to a CSV file.

Files Information:

       •	The file “part_1_mars_news.ipynb” is used to complete the first requirement.
       •	The file “part_2_mars_weather.ipynb” is used to complete the second requirement.
       •	Two output files “mars_articles.json” and “mars_data.csv” are in “Output” folder.
